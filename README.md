# Gesture_based_Home_Automation_System
### An IOT based project which is used to control home appliances through hand gestures.
***
#### Overview of the project

Home Automation is the new trend in a consumer market. There are many home automation systems with different features and facilities. All the home automation systems are used to control home appliances through a remote control. The remote control can be a stationed unit or a wireless remote. The remote used for controlling appliances usually have keys or touch-based sensors. In this project, a home automation system is designed which can be controlled by hand gestures.


Hand gestures are detected by Ultrasonic sensor and Pi camera module. Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect motion of hand within a certain range. Pi camera is used to capture the different hand gestures provided by the user.


This project is built on Raspberry Pi 3 and has LCD module for user interface, Ultrasonic sensor and Pi camera for Motion Detection and a relay module to drive appliances ON or OFF.
